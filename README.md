I am a lifelong computer enthusiast and newly found cyber security enthusiast focusing on a fulfilling career in cyber security. As a recently graduated student of the UC Berkeley Extension Cybersecurity Bootcamp, I've gained hands-on experience in many aspects of cyber security including analysis, system hardening, penetration testing and network monitoring. I also use man resources both online and my host machine such as Tryhackme.com, Vulnhub.com as well as GNS3 and other virtual machines. My GitHub showcases projects that I have done to prepare me for the challenges of a cyber security engineer role, as well as journal as sorts to keep myself accountable to ensure I maintain my growth at a steady pace along this journey. I'm excited to connect with others in the field and contribute to the cybersecurity community.
